Generative AI Usage

- ChatGPT was used to help handle issues that arose in my code. When I was stuck in my code and didn't know how to proceed I would ask chatgpt to help me understand the issue I was facing and provide guidance.
- I also used chatGPT to add error handling and docstrings. ChatGPT did not do everything without errors so I had to go through and make sure everything was correct and fix wrong statements and code.
- When the console.log outputted errors I didn't understand, I would ask chatGPT to help me understand what the error codes meant and what could be causing the errors.
- Code that was generated by chatGPT was riddled with errors and was used as a baseline to help me develop my ideas further.
- I always tried to write my own code and then test it, if I couldn't figure it out then I turned to chatGPT.
- I had trouble figuring out adding the location and chatGPT was unable to help so I tried Claude AI, it was able to finally help me fix my errors.
